In this course we study the behaviour of offshore structures. These structures are very complex and they typically require sophisticated models that are not in the scope of this course. However, we can simplify them in such a way that the overall behaviour can still be well described.

Here we will consider models that are composed by the following structural elements:
- Point mass
- Rigid body
- Spring and damper
- Bar and rod
- Euler-Bernoulli beam
- Timoshenko beam
